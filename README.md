# Polynomial-Regression-From-Scratch-Using-Python

This project demonstrates the implementation of Polynomial Regression from scratch in Python, without using any machine learning libraries like scikit-learn. Polynomial Regression is a form of regression analysis where the relationship between the independent variable 𝑥 and the dependent variable 𝑦 is modeled as an nth degree polynomial.
